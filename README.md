This is my learning material adopted by Apple's FoodTracker App Tutorial and combined with AWS Mobile SDK.

AWS S3 integrated to Foodtracker app via Amazon Cognite

Basic Funtionalities of App:
 - Uploading pictures to AWS S3 
 - Deleting pictures from AWS S3



Note:
If you keep getting permission error make sure you have setup the permission properly in the IAM Roles created.Github didnâ€™t allow me to add framework . So you might want to explicitly add by following the link [Amazon IOS Dependencies](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios)
